# VulnerabilityReportingStandard (VRS)
The vulnerability reporting standard should specify a machine-readable standard for reporting found vulnerabilities and security threats to clients.
The intention of this is that if you order a pentest, red teaming, config review, etc. that it is reported in a machine-readable standardized forma. This should allow the organization receiving the report to be able to ingest all the reported findings into an application of the organisation's choice.

## Basic concept
Vulnerability Scanners all have a slightly different way of reporting the same vulnerability. Therefore, it would be beneficial to a company who need to manage all vulnerabilities to have a standard format like the one described below:

data fields
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| UUID | ReportingDate | Systems | Title | Description | Risk | CVE | MitigationAdvisory | SecurityScore | PublicExploit | Reference | 
|------|---------------|---------|-------|-------------|------|-----|--------------------|---------------|---------------|-----------|
|      |               |         |       |             |      |     |                    |               |               |           |

### UUID (one entry)
Unique ID to identify the securtiy flaw. Should be unique and may not be suitable to be taken over from the reporting entity.

example: OC1234567890

### ReportingDate (one entry)
Date the security flaw was found in the audited scope.

example: 20230725

### Systems (multiple entry)
List all Systems affected by the security flaw in the audited scope. List them as FQDNs or IPs (do not list IP and FQDN of the same system, as it is an unnecessary dublicate, do list multiple network interfaces on the same system)

example: 192.168.1.1|test.local.com

### Title (one entry)
Descriptive Title of the security flaw. It should explain as much as possible in one line.

example: Weak Password found

### Description (one entry)
Detailed Description of the security flaw and how it was found. Include reproducable steps.

example: In a file at \\server\location\text.txt there was a password which was weak. 

### Risk (one entry)
Describe the Risk to the system. What is the impact of a security flaw on the confidentiality, integrity or availability. 

example: An adversary may compromise the system and take over control

### CVE (multiple entry)
Include all known CVE's this Risk has. List all CVE's that are filed for this security flaw.

example: CSV-2023-00

### MitigationAdvisory (one entry)
Give a comprehensive guidance on how to remediate, patch or avoid the security flaw. If possible be specific and avoid general recomondations. If there are multiple possibilities give as many as suitable and advice wich one is the more secure solution.

example: Install Microsoft patch KB1234567 see details in: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/patchnotes

### SecurityScore (multiple entry)
Specify which security metric you are using. To each Security Type specify a score in Security Score. If you use public scoreing system adhere tho their values.

example: CSV3 8.3, OSSTMM3 exposure 

### PublicExploit (multiple entry)
List public exploits. Also each Public explit should be ratet on difficulty of exploit. Suggested choices are simple (1), low (2), medium (3), high (4), hard (5)

example: https://github.com/exploit low

### Reference (multiple entry)
Add any references or referencing material.

example: https://url.test.com
