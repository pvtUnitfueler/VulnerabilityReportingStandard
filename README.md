# VulnerabilityReportingStandard (VRS)
The vulnerability reporting standard should specify a machine readable standard for reporting found vulnerabilities and security threats to clients.
The intention of this is that if you order a pentest, redteaming, config review, etc. that it is reported in a machine readable standardized forma. This should allow the organization receiving the report to be able to ingest all the reported findings into an application of the organisations choice.

## Basic concept
Vulnerability Scanners all have a slightly different way of reporting the same vulnerability. Therefore it would be benefitial to a company who need to manage all vulnerabilites to have a standard format like the one described below:

data format
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
